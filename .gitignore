#This is the git ignore file used in Duck Hunted
#Note that ! negates an ignore. We ignore everything in Library then
#un-ignore the metadata folder and some specific files
#Use at your own risk, this may totally destroy your project, but it worked for us
 
#NOTE: this will cause your collaborators to re-import assets periodically
